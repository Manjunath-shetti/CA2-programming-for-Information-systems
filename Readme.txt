Manjunath shetti(10606018) contribution:
I've learned various information system-related concepts from this assignment,
I have made use of my prior knowledge and created main html pages for our website requirements. 
I implemented Django framework and created Django project which is oniline_food_ordering_system.
I modified and added URLs files and models in main project file. 
I established connectivity by creating Django app to our main project file using python and modified all app file in urls.py to create URL to all other pages.
However, Django app helped in connecting the backend with the frontend.
Further, I created templates using HTML for restaurant, product, type and user pages. Password change, user dashboard, forgot password, user report, order edit, order items, order listing, type listing , payment, product details and product listing these are HTML files created.
Further apache and sql in XAMPP control panel was not running successfully it was shutting down unexpectedly. It was bit challenging for me to make apache and sql run. I resolved it by going to configuration in XAMPP and by changing the ports

Nikunj nasit contribution:

I have created all the backend database in sql, which is required for our website in the CA2, I added
backend queries to views.py for the restaurant page file, type page file, user page file and products
page file. It was fetched by url.py . Further I exchanged my css knowledge with my group mates too. It
was challenging for me to Handle multiple file with different sources of Database.
However at the end I completed the backend part to make our project sucessfull
